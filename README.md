# EECS1720_Project01
- This is an extension about google notification!
- Since I don't learn too much related knowledge about HTML,CSS,JS / Google Extension in this course, I have been reading a lot of materials and articles. It is too difficult for me to work on this project. Some of the code is confusing, and I don't know how it works.
- For this project, I just briefly read related articles and examples and make a simple extension this time.
